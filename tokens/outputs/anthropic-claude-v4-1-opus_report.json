Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics, using quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition, unlike classical bits which are either 0 or 1. This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information in parallel, potentially solving certain complex problems exponentially faster than traditional computers, particularly in areas like cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization. While still in early stages of development, quantum computers promise to revolutionize computing by tackling problems that would take classical computers millions of years to solve.
