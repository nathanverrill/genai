Quantum computing is a revolutionary field that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex calculations. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information and solve certain problems exponentially faster than traditional computers, potentially transforming fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization.
