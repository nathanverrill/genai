Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. It uses quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing and potentially solving complex problems much faster. Quantum algorithms can provide exponential speedup for certain tasks, such as factoring large numbers or simulating quantum systems.
