Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the unique properties of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to process information in ways classical computers cannot. Unlike classical bits that exist as either 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, potentially allowing quantum computers to solve certain complex problems exponentially faster than today's most powerful supercomputers.
