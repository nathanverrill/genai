Quantum computing is a revolutionary technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations exponentially faster and more efficiently than classical computers. By harnessing the power of qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, quantum computers can solve complex problems that are currently unsolvable or require an unfeasible amount of time to solve classically. This enables breakthroughs in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and simulation.
