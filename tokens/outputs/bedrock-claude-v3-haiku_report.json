Quantum computing is a novel approach to information processing that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations. Unlike classical computers that use bits represented as 0s and 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in superposition, allowing them to process information in a fundamentally different way and potentially solve certain problems much faster than classical computers. The development of practical, large-scale quantum computers remains an active area of research, with potential applications in fields like cryptography, simulation, and optimization.
