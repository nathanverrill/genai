Quantum computing is a rapidly-evolving field that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. It relies on quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling parallel processing of vast amounts of data. Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography, materials science, and drug discovery by solving problems that are intractable for classical computers.
