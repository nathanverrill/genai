Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically quantum superposition and entanglement, to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. While classical computers use bits that exist in definite states of 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing them to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than traditional computers. This technology holds immense promise for solving complex problems in cryptography, drug discovery, financial modeling, and artificial intelligence that are currently intractable for even the most powerful supercomputers.
