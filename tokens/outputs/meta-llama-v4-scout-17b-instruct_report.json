Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations and operations on data. It has the potential to solve complex problems that are difficult or impossible for classical computers to solve, by using quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows for exponentially faster processing of certain calculations, making it a promising technology for fields such as cryptography, optimization, and simulation.
