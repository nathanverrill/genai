Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach to computation that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics, using quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition, unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1. This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information in parallel and solve certain complex problems—such as cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization—exponentially faster than traditional computers. However, quantum computers are highly sensitive to environmental interference and require extremely controlled conditions to maintain quantum states, making them still largely experimental and complementary to, rather than replacements for, classical computing.
