Quantum computing is a form of computation that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers, making them well-suited for solving complex problems in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.
