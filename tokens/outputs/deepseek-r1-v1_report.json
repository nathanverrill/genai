Quantum computing is an advanced computing paradigm that utilizes quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to process information. Unlike classical bits, which are binary (0 or 1), quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling quantum computers to solve certain complex problems—like cryptography, optimization, and molecular modeling—exponentially faster than traditional computers.
