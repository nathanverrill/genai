Quantum computing is a revolutionary technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information using quantum bits (qubits) instead of traditional binary bits. Unlike classical computers that use 0s and 1s, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition, allowing quantum computers to perform complex calculations exponentially faster than classical computers. This enables quantum computers to potentially solve intricate problems in fields like cryptography, drug discovery, and complex system modeling that are currently intractable for traditional computing systems.
